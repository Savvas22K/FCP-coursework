Task 2  Defuant Model SimulationThis project simulates opinion formation within a society using the Defuant model.Before running this simulation, Python should be installed. Additionally, Matplotlib and NumPy libraires are required£¨pip install numpy matplotlib£©.In order to run the model with default parameters£ºpython <file name>.py -defuantTo run the code with custom beta and threshold values£ºpython <file name>.py -defuant -beta <beta value> -threshold <threshold value>To run the test code of defuant model£ºpython <file name>.py -test_defuantThe simulation generates a visualization of the distribution and evolution of the opinions over time and saved as a PNG file.
