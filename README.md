To run our code the following packages are needed: numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, matplotlib.cm as cm, math, random, argparse.

The Ising model does not work with some of the other tasks on some laptops so run them separately if it doesn't initially . The Defuant model saves a graph on the same folder as the python file. When a graph is displayed, to curry on running the model the window showing the figure needs to be closed. To test the networks type in terminal -test_networks

Run the " .py" file in terminal

For task 1, type -ising_model to call the program, -test_ising to test the model, -alpha N where N is a chosen alpha value and -external M where M is chosen external value.
I was responsible for task 3

For task 3 (done by Savvas Kalisperides), type -network N, where N is the number of nodes desired.

For task 5 we used the Ising model
